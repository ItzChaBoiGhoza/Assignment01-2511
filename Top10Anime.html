                            <p> It is set in a world where humanity lives inside cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect

                                to exterminate the Titans after a Titan brings about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother.

                                After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household, brothers Edward and Alphonse are left 
                                in a catastrophic new reality. Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation, the boys attempted 
                                to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body 
                                disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in the physical realm by 
                                binding it to a hulking suit of armor.

                                tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange 
                                function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.
